    <h1>Oliver Queen</h1>
    <p>"When my <a href="#">father</a> sacrificed himself, when he gave me my extra years, what was I doing with them? I was wasting them. I was drowning myself in this sea of... of pain and darkness and saying, 'Ollie, if you just... If you cross one more name off <a href="#">The List</a>, if you save your <a href="#">city</a> one more time, then you'll absolve yourself of all of this guilt'. And I was wrong. This guilt is never going to go away. It is something that you have to learn to live with. That is why people sacrificed themselves. That is why I sacrificed myself for you, so that in all of this darkness... you... could be a guiding light... a hero."
        —Oliver Queen to <a href="#">Barry Allen</a></p>
        <br>
    <p><b>Oliver Jonas "Ollie" Queen</b> (May 16, 1985 -  December 10, 2019 December 10, 2019 - the <a href="#">dawn of time</a> briefly resurrected 2023/2049) was a billionaire and former playboy, turned archer superhero of <a href="#">Star City</a>, and the leader of <a href="#">Team Arrow</a>, who <a href="#">later died</a> as savior of the <a href="#">multiverse</a>. He was the son of the late <a href="#">Robert Queen</a> and <a href="#">Moira Queen</a>, the older paternal half-brother of <a href="#">Emiko Adachi</a>, the older maternal half-brother of <a href="#">Thea Queen</a>, the husband of <a href="#">Felicity Smoak</a>, and the father of <a href="#">William Clayton</a> and <a href="#">Mia Queen</a>. He was also the ex-boyfriend/good friend of the late <a href="#">Laurel Lance</a>, <a href="#">Sara Lance</a>, and <a href="#">Shado</a>. He was also the best friend of <a href="#">Tommy Merlyn</a> and <a href="#">John Diggle</a>, and a good friend of <a href="#">Barry Allen</a>, <a href="#">Quentin Lance</a>, <a href="#">Roy Harper</a>Roy Harper, <a href="#">Lyla Michaels</a>, <a href="#">Anatoly Knyazev</a>, <a href="#"></a>, <a href="#">Kara Danvers</a>, <a href="#">Rene Ramirez</a>, <a href="#">Dinah Drake</a>, and <a href="#">Curtis Holt</a>.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Oliver was lost from society after his family's <a href="#">yacht</a> sank and made it to the island of <a href="#">Lian Yu</a>, where he went on a mission of survival and self-discovery, learning skills that include, and aren't limited to, archery, swordsmanship, hand-hand combat, etc. He traveled to <a href="#">China</a> and <a href="#">Russia</a>Russia on missions as an agent of <a href="#">A.R.G.U.S.</a> for some time, became a member of the <a href="#">Solntsevskaya Bratva</a> known as <b>Kapot</b> (Russian for <em>Car Hood</em>), and the murderous <a href="#">vigilante</a> <b>Luchnik/Kapiushon</b> (Russian for <em>Acher/Hood</em>). After being presumed dead and lost at sea for five years, Oliver returned home with a mission to save his city from crime and corruption. He began his crusade as an archer who would eventually become known as <b>the Hood, Starling City Vigilante</b>, or simply <b>the Vigilante</b>. As the Hood, Oliver was willing to use lethal force by targeting members on his father's <a href="#">list</a>.</p>
        <br>
    <p>After <a href="#">the Undertaking</a> caused the death of his best friend, Tommy, Oliver decided to continue his crusade, renamed as <b>the Arrow</b>, stylized as the <b>"Emerald Archer"</b>, while also making a vow to avoid killing whenever possible to honor Tommy's memory. As the Arrow, Oliver continued working with Diggle and Felicity, met forensic scientist Barry from <a href="#">Central City</a>, and had confrontations with Slade who he met on the island and had presumed dead. Five months after saving Starling City from <a href="#">the Siege</a>, the Arrow was declared as a hero to the citizens of Starling City.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Following the initial death of Laurel's sister and his ex-girlfriend, Sara, Oliver came into conflict with <a href="#">Ra's al Ghul</a>, the leader of the <a href="#">League of Assassins</a> who threatened to kill the people of Starling City if he did not not find Sara's killer, forcing Oliver to falsely claim responsibility in order to fight Ra's to the death, where Oliver was vastly outmatched and defeated and almost killed. Oliver survived the duel and by law had to become the next <a href="#">Ra's al Ghul</a>, but he refused, resulting in Roy taking the fall after Ra's outed Oliver's identity to the public. When Ra's nearly killed Thea, Oliver gave in to the League in order to save his half-sister's life and joined them under the identity of <b>Al Sah-him </b> (Arabic: السهم; for Arrow). When Ra's planned to have Oliver destroy his home, Starling City, a tradition all becoming the next <a href="">Ra's al Ghul</a> must commit, an event which would be known as <a href="#">the Outbreak</a>. Oliver, who was seemingly erased from his old life, returned to his team to stop the attack and Ra's al Ghul once and for all. After saving Starling City, Oliver retired from vigilantism and began a new life in <a href="#">Ivy Town</a> with Felicity.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Five months after retiring, Oliver was called back to Starling City, renamed Star City in honor of the seemingly-dead <a href="#">Ray Palmer</a>, and took up a new code-name, <b>Green Arrow</b>, to continue fighting for the people of his city. After stopping the terrorist organization <a href="#">H.I.V.E.</a>, and its leader <a href="#">Damien Darhk</a>, from completing <a href="#">Genesis</a>, his rallying of Star City as Oliver Queen earned him the full support of the people and soon after was made the mayor.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Five months after becoming mayor, he came into conflict with <a href="#">Adrian Chase</a>, aka Prometheus, a serial killer wanting to avenge his father, <a href="#">Justin Claybourne</a> and destroy Oliver's life. When Chase's team captured Oliver's friends and family, their final confrontation was met on Lian Yu. While Oliver freed everyone, including his illegitimate son, William Clayton, Chase killed himself to detonate bombs placed all over Lian Yu in an attempt to kill everyone on it.</p>
        <br>
    <p>After the events on Lian Yu, Oliver decided to raise William, as a promise he made to the latter's mother; <a href="#">Samantha Clayton</a>, who died on the island. While Oliver struggled with his secret identity as the vigilante being compromised by the <a href="#">F.B.I</a>, he also had to deal with <a href="#">Cayden James</a> who planned to destroy Star City after believing Oliver killed his son, <a href="#">Owen Post</a>. After defeating James, it gave rise to his true manipulator <a href="#">Ricardo Diaz</a>, who subsequently began to take control of Star City's government by using all of James' assets and amass a huge army.</p>
        <br>
    <p>In a desperate effort to take down Diaz and liberate Star City from his control, Oliver turns to the FBI for their help in exchange for turning himself in for his crimes as a vigilante. Although they failed to capture Diaz, the city was taken back and Oliver publicly confessed he was Green Arrow before being sent to <a href="#">Slabside Maximum Security Prison</a>, being identified as <b>Inmate 4587.</b></p>
        <br>
    <p>Oliver was released six months after Diaz was captured, and faced with the emergence of his half-sister, <a href="#">Emiko Adachi</a>, who was using the Green Arrow's name and motives. He decided to separate himself from the impersonator and continue serving the city by officially using his skills as a deputized black-ops member of the SCPD. After ending the conflict with Emiko and the <a href="#">Ninth Circle</a>, Oliver briefly went into hiding with Felicity, who was pregnant. After Mia's birth, he received a follow-up visit from <a href="#">Mar Novu</a>, reminding him of the promise he made to save the multiverse.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Oliver was killed by an army of <a href="#">shadow demons</a>, stalling for time to save billions of people on <a href="#">Earth-38</a>, but he was resurrected by <a href="#">John Contantine</a> in a <a href="#">Lazarus Pit</a> on <a href="#">Earth-18</a>. Mia went to try and save him, but <a href="#">Jim Corrigan</a> convinced her that Oliver was needed in <a href="#">Purgatory</a> and as a result, his soul chose to remain there and go with Corrigan while his body was vaporized by <a href="#">antimatter</a>. About a month later, Oliver returned to <a href="#">the living world</a> as the new <a href="#"><b>Spectre</b></a>, but he <a href="#">sacrificed his life</a> again to create <a href="#">Earth-Prime</a>, as well as the new <a href="#">multiverse</a>. Oliver was also able to change events to save Moira, Tommy, Quentin, and Emiko, as well as restore <a href="#">Sara Diggle</a>'s existence.</p>
        <br>
    <p>As the Spectre, Oliver would spend the rest of eternity in Purgatory watching over the multiverse. He also kept an eye on his friends and family, specifically his children William and Mia, and witnessed John Diggle with a "<a href="#">cube</a>" designed to tempt him. In 2023 when <a href="#">Ramsey Rosso</a>Ramsey Rosso attempted to spread his infection across the multiverse and had <a href="#">Wally West</a> kill Barry Allen, Oliver briefly returned as the Green Arrow to help Barry stop him. With their destiny written, Felicity would reunite with Oliver in the <a href="#">afterlife</a> in 2040.</p>

    <figcaption class="thumbcaption"> <p class="caption">"Oliver and "<a href="#">Tommy</a>" as children at " <a href="#">Rebecca Merlyn</a>'s funeral. </p></figcaption>
    <p>Oliver Queen was born on May 16, 1985 in <a href="#">Starling City</a>into the esteemed <a href="#">Queen family</a>to his parents; billionaires <a href="#">Robert</a> and <a href="#">Moira Queen</a>. When he was seven years old, Oliver met and befriended <a href="#">Tommy Merlyn</a> and later, <a href="#">Laurel Lance</a>, both who would become his lifelong best friends. Oliver had a younger sister, <a href="#">Thea</a>Thea, whom he was very close to and protective of. He nicknamed Thea "Speedy" since he always chased after her when she was a kid. Every <a href="#">Chistmas</a>, Oliver and Thea would race to see who could eat the holiday candy canes the fastest. While learning how to drive, Oliver once chipped the side paint off of his father's Maserati.</p>
    <figcaption class="thumb "></figcaption>
    <p>Once Oliver entered his late teens and early 20s, he started sleeping around with other women and got into multiple social scandals by himself or with Tommy, including assaulting a paparazzi bystander,[10] driving while intoxicated, stealing a taxi, urinating on a police officer, and using a helicopter to impress Maria Sharapova at the <a href="#">U.S.</a> Open. At some point, Oliver and Tommy became acquainted with <a href="#">McKenna Hall</a> and met Laurel's sister, <a href="#">Sara</a>. Oliver's education was chaotic as well; he dropped out of four Ivy League schools, not even bothering to tell his parents about the last one until sometime after. Additionally, Oliver mentioned that the only book he ever bothered to read in college was <a href="#">The Odyssey</a>.</p>
    <p>However, Oliver did have some engineering skills due to working with his father, who was an aspiring pilot and sometimes performed his own maintenance with his son. Robert also taught Oliver how to operate a plane and the two often went flying together. As a teenager, Oliver used these abilities to hot-wire <a href="#">Malcolm Merlyn</a>'s car four times, which resulted in him getting grounded for an entire summer.</p>
    <p>At some point in 2004, Oliver indirectly ran into <a href="#">Simon Morrison</a> when he successfully stole the latter's girlfriend. At another time, Oliver "slept" <a href="#">Vesper Fairchild</a> during her exposé on white-collar crime in order to convince her that his family company, <a href="#">Queen Consolidated</a>Queen Consolidated was clean. Over the following years, he would forget about both of these incidents.</p>
    <p>In 2005, Oliver would begin dating his longtime friend Laurel, and they fell in love with one another. However, Laurel's father, <a href="#">Quentin</a>, disapproved of their relationship and once threatened to use a taser on Oliver after catching the two in bed together. Despite this, Oliver enjoyed spending time with Laurel and her family as he felt unburdened from being Robert Queen's son, according to Moira. Oliver also held Quentin in high regard, secretly wanting to earn his validation.</p>
    <!-- Image -->
    <p>Sometime after he began dating Laurel, Oliver cheated on her by sleeping with a college classmate, <a href="#">Samantha Clayton</a>, in or before November 2005, and accidentally got her pregnant. Distressed and worried about his future, Oliver shared the news with his mother, expressing he "screwed up", and as such, his belief Robert would "kill" him. Unbeknownst to him, Moira stepped in and paid off Samantha to raise the <a href="#">unborn child</a> in <a href="#">Central City</a>Central City, lie to Oliver that she miscarried, and never speak to him again. Oliver was both saddened and relieved upon learning of his dashed fatherhood, unaware of the truth. Confiding in his mother once more, Oliver thanked her for being there for him, to which Moira promised that her son was never without her.</p>
    <p>In 2007, after Moira caught Laurel sneaking away to Oliver's room in the <a href="#">Queen Mansion</a>, Laurel suggested that she and Oliver could live in their own home, bringing up how their friends, <a href="#">Ray</a> and <a href="#">Jean</a>, had recently decided to get an apartment together. Oliver initially agreed to moving in with her, but he quickly began having doubts. Rather than talk to Laurel about his doubts, Oliver panicked, causing him to start cheating on her in an effort to back out of the commitment. He hurt his relationship with Laurel by sleeping with Sara, who before had a crush on him, and eventually inviting her to join him on his father's three-week trip on the <a href="#"><em>Queen's Gambit</em></a>. Before he boarded the <em>Gambit</em>, Laurel visited Oliver to say goodbye and gave him a photograph of herself for when he got lonely overseas.</p>
    
    <p><b>5 Years in Hell</b></p>
    
    <p><b>Shipwrecked on Lian Yu</b></p>

    <p>That night on the <i>Queen's Gambit</i>, Oliver was in bed with Sara as they drank wine and flirted. Suddenly, the yacht (having been sabotaged) sank. Oliver witnessed Sara being swooped away by the rushing water before being pulled under. He eventually resurfaced from the ocean with Robert and a crew member, <a href="#">Dave Hackett</a>, dragging him into a life raft, the three of them being the only known survivors. Oliver tried to go back and look for Sara, but Robert told him it was too late, much to his devastation. After days of drifting at sea and running low on provisions, Robert realized that there was enough for maybe one person and chose to give his son a chance at survival. He revealed to Oliver that their family's wealth had been built on the suffering of others and he was not the man his son thought he was. Robert urged his son to right his wrongs and be better than he was. He then took out a gun and proceeded to shoot Hackett, much to Oliver's horror, before turning it on himself. Robert told Oliver once last time, "Survive" before shooting himself amidst his son's pleas.</p>
    <p>Sometime later, Oliver washed ashore upon an <a href="">island</a>, where he built a makeshift hut to spend the night in. The next morning, He spotted birds descending on his father's body and frantically rushed to shield him, only to suddenly vomit upon touching Robert's hand. While burying his father's body, Oliver found a <a href="#">notebook</a> with a strange symbol filled with seemingly blank pages in his pocket. Immediately after, a hooded man named <a href="#">Yao Fei Gulong</a> ambushed Oliver and shot an arrow into his shoulder. Oliver screamed in pain before collapsing and passing out.</p>
    <p>Oliver awoke some time later in Yao Fei's camp, where he tended to Oliver's wound. Later, when the man fell asleep, Oliver tried to flee, only to trigger a snare. Yao Fei soon arrived, cutting him down and leaving Oliver with a warning of the island's dangers. Oliver was left with no other choice but to follow him. Shortly after they left, trap which Oliver sprung unknowingly attracted the attention of a group of armed masked men, who examined it.</p>
    <p>Over the next few days, Oliver spent most of his time gazing at his picture of Laurel until Yeo Fei brought him a bird trapped in a cage. Oliver was confused, to which Yao Fei simply repeated, "Shēngcún", gesturing him to kill the bird if he wanted to eat. Horrified at the thought, Oliver refused at first but later, driven by hunger, he reluctantly broke the bird's neck. While eating, Yao Fei told Oliver that his mantra, "Shēngcún", means to survive. Yao Fei warned that Oliver would be forced to take more lives in the future, and advised him to forget about Laurel if he wanted to survive on the island.</p>
    <p>Oliver accompanied Yao Fei hunting one day. When Yao Fei killed a rabbit for dinner, Oliver refused to touch the body and tried to shoot with Yao Fei's bow as per his instructions. He managed to successfully launch an arrow but missed his intended target, a tree. Oliver then went to retrieve the arrow and dead rabbit, but was ambushed and captured by a group of armed men, who imprisoned him in an underground cage. Terrified, Oliver attempted to beg for his life, to no avail. They brought Oliver to their camp, where he was then interrogated by their leader, <a href="">Edward Fyers</a>. Fyers showed him a picture of Yao Fei, asking if Oliver had seen him, revealing the man's name as well as the island's; <a href="">Lian Yu</a> (meaning "purgatory" in Mandarin) Oliver denied any knowledge of Yao Fei in order to protect him. Not believing him, Fyers ordered an <a href="">an employee</a> of his to extract information from Oliver.</p>
    <p>The man tortured Oliver by slicing his torso with a katana. Despite the pain, Oliver refused to divulge anything. After a period of time, Yao Fei barged in, rescuing a severely injured Oliver and bringing him back to the cave. He then left to lead Fyers' men away from their hideout, but not before telling Oliver to survive, and sealing the entrance to prevent Oliver from following him.</p>
    <p>Injured and alone in the cave, Oliver began began burning the pages of his father's book to keep a fire going. He suddenly experienced a hallucination of Robert telling him to survive despite Oliver's contemplating suicide, otherwise Robert's sacrifice would have been for nothing. After awakening, Oliver tore another page out of the book, but just as he was about to throw it onto the fire, the heat from the flames causes letters to appear on the paper. He proceeded to do the same with other pages, and various names began to appear on the pages. Oliver then promised the hallucination of his father that he would live up to this responsibility.</p>
    <p>Yao Fei returned a while later, bringing with him a captured Fyers. He told Oliver that Fyers had a plane that could take them off the island. They made their way through the woods until they were ambushed by Wintergreen and Fyers' men, with Fyers admitting how convenient it appeared to be that Yao Fei captured him so easily. Yao Fei told Oliver to run and began fighting the men. Unfortunately, he was defeated and knocked unconscious by Billy. From a safe distance, Oliver watched them take Yao Fei and then ran away.</p>
    <p>One of Fyers' men continued to search for Oliver after Yao Fei was captured. Armed with only a knife, Oliver was eventually forced to confront him. The skirmish resulted in them tumbling and falling down into a stream. The soldier landed hard on a rock while Oliver ended up in the water. He managed to swim out and donned the uniform of the dead man, finding a set of keys and a map of the island in one of the pockets. Using the map, Oliver found his way to the camp where Fyers and his men were based. There, unfortunately accompanied by Fyers (who didn't seem to recognize him due to wearing a balaclava) he managed to make his way to where Yao Fei was being held prisoner, but once there, Fyers knocked down Oliver and put him in one of the cells.</p>
    <p>When he came to, Fyers told him he'd known who he was because of his eyes, which tell everything about a person, which was the reason why his men all wore balaclavas. Fyers then rebuked Oliver for putting his trust in the wrong people, specifically Yao Fei. He motioned to the soldier next to him, who had been the first to talk to Oliver upon his arrival in the camp. The soldier took off his balaclava and revealed himself to be in fact Yao Fei, who had began working for Fyers.[12] Yao Fei proceeded to seemingly kill Oliver in a fighting circle, however he secretly used a technique in order to fake Oliver's death. As he hit the water, Oliver was revived and swam to shore. In his pocket, he found a map with a route marked out. Oliver proceeded to follow the route, leading to an abandoned plane.</p>
    <p>Before he could do a thing, a man jumped down, threatening to kill him. Oliver told him that he was sent by Yao Fei, and the man seemed to drop his suspicions, introducing himself as <a href="">Slade Wilson</a>. Slade then told Oliver that there was an airfield, and he and Yao Fei had been observing it for months, that they were going to get off the island together. He then threw a sword to Oliver and told him of his belief that Yao Fei sent Oliver to him because he knew that he could not take the air field alone. Slade then challenged Oliver to a brief sword fight in order to gauge Oliver's fighting skills. He was unimpressed, significantly beating Oliver and told him how he fought much worse than a girl.</p>
    <p>Slade then knocked him out. Oliver woke, tied to a chair. Slade, in order to keep his location secret, decided to kill Oliver, however, Oliver managed to escape his bonds by breaking his hand, and then punched Slade in the face. Amused, Slade thought that there might have been a fighter inside of Oliver after all and decided to train Oliver instead. As Oliver went to choose a weapon, he found a bi-colored solid black and orange fabric mask, identical to the one worn by the man who had tortured him under Fyers' orders. When questioned about this, Slade explained that he and his old partner, and former friend, wore the same mask, that they had come to the island to rescue Yao as a mission from the <a href="">Australian Secret Intelligence Service.</a></p>
    <p>The two progressively fought over an unspecified amount of time. Oliver almost gave up, though was quickly re-motivated by Slade. When the time came, the two of them made their way to Edward's camp, and ultimately the airstrip to a ride home. They set up camp, and Oliver tried to start a fire for several hours, before Slade pulled out a lighter and helped, bemused at Oliver's anger. In return, Slade reminisced about his and his partner, Billy Wintergreen's, arrival on the island.</p>
    <p>A day or so later, Oliver accidentally stepped on a land mine left over from a previous war. Slade ran to hide as a group of soldiers approached a masked Oliver. Oliver explained his situation, as Slade had deserted him, and they surveyed the mine. Suddenly, Slade jumped from his hiding spot, slicing through the soldiers with his sword, replacing Oliver with one of them. They continued towards the camp, finally reaching it at dark. Oliver, aided by Slade's sniping, raced stealthily to the communications tower. He attempted to quietly take out the only man in there, only resulting in having a gun pointed at his face. He tried to remove it, but his technique failed. Luckily, Slade reached him just in time, stabbing the man through the gut. They were able to contact the plane, allowing it clearance to land.</p>    
    <p>Slade left Oliver on his own and Oliver, seeing his chance, grabbed a phone and called Laurel, hoping to make up for his wrongdoings. Before he could speak, Slade returned and stopped him, reminding him that it could be monitored. After a short argument, Oliver went to find Yao Fei and rescue him. Yao Fei explained that he was only staying for a person. Fyers and Wintergreen entered the tent, leading Yao Fei to knock out Oliver. When Oliver came to, he was forced into the middle of a circle. After questioning Fyers, he discovered that he meant for Wintergreen to kill him.</p> 
    <p>Before this could happen, Slade caused a distraction so that he could snipe several soldiers and Oliver could run to safety. Oliver watched as Slade and Wintergreen faced off, with Slade overpowering his former friend. As they were leaving, Slade was shot. Oliver helped to protect them as they left, finally knocking out his first soldier with the move Slade had shown him earlier. When they reached Slade's plane, Oliver helped remove the bullet in Slade's arm. He then joked that his only friend on the island was named "Wilson".</p>
    <p>Later, Oliver checked Slade's wound and found that it was infected. He recalled the herbs that Yao Fei had given him that prevented infection from his arrow wound and offered to go get them. Slade said that he wouldn't last an hour out there, and Oliver believed that he could get them in 45 minutes. He then went to Yao Fei's cave, discovering a man tied up there. The man explains that he was the only survivor of a shipwreck, like Oliver, and had discovered Fyers' soldiers, whom had beaten and taken him to the cave. Oliver, believing it to be a trap, grabbed the herbs and left the man there, returning to Slade with the herbs.[31] Oliver began working on a broken down radio transmitter to find a way to get off the island with Slade.</p>
    <p>After working on it for a while, they were able to hear conversations between radios, but unable to communicate back. After listening for a while, the two learned that Fyers had ordered the shipment of a missile launcher big enough to destroy an entire army.[18] Oliver and Slade were able to sneak in to Fyers' compound, where they stole the launcher's ignition chip. They called Fyers on his radio and told him that they would return the chip in exchange for a way off of the island.</p>
    <p>Oliver and Slade soon met with Fyers, who quickly backed down from their deal by revealing to them that he would kill <a href="">Shado</a>, Yao Fei's daughter, if they did not give him the chip. Oliver then realized that it was because of Shado that Yao Fei joined Fyers' cause. Oliver and Slade escaped with Shado in tow, but soon learned that Fyers' men had found the chip while they had rendezvoused with Fyers, and had taken it back. Shado then told them how she knew of Fyers' plan.[33] Shado decided to begin teaching Oliver archery so that he could help them defeat Fyers. She proceeded to get him to fill a bowl with water, and then continuously slap it.</p>
    <p>After a while, Oliver became frustrated and asked Shado the purpose of the exercise, and she showed him that because he had spent so long slapping the water, he then had the strength in his hands to pull back a bow.[34] She then told him that he had to learn how to shoot, during which the two grew closer romantically despite Oliver confessing that he was in love with Laurel despite it being complicated to Shado. After learning how to shoot, the three were shocked to see Yao Fei arrive at their compound. However, he was promptly forced to reveal that he had brought Fyers' soldiers along with him.</p>
    <p>The soldiers brought the three of them to Fyers' compound, where Oliver saw that one of the soldiers was the young man who he had met in the cave who had claimed to be trapped there. Fyers revealed that the reason he was on the island was because he and his men were hired to shoot down a Ferris Aircraft on its way to China, thus destroying China's economy. Fyers then threatened to kill Shado if Yao Fei did not film a video taking responsibility for the terrorist attack. After reluctance, Yao Fei agreed, but subtly handed Oliver a knife. After filming the video, Fyers shot Yao Fei in the head, killing him. Just as Fyers and his men prepared to fire the missile, Oliver cut himself free using Yao Fei's knife, and he, Slade, and Shado, fought Fyers and his men. Fyers, however, was able to get the missile fired at the plane, and Oliver and Shado went to manually redirect the missile while Slade covered them.</p>
    <p>Just as Shado was about to place the chip inside the switchboard, she was attacked from behind, and Oliver managed to redirect the missile, which hit Fyers' compound instead, with both Slade and Shado still there. Oliver went to search for them, and found Slade alive, but then turned around to see that Fyers was still alive and had Shado in his custody. Oliver found Yao Fei's wooden compound bow and arrow, and pointed it at Fyers, who mused about how his meticulously-executed plan over the past two years was undone by a shipwrecked boy, and admitted that he would've gotten him off of the island if Oliver had stopped messing with Fyers' plans. Before Fyers could make a move, Oliver shot an arrow at his throat, killing him.</p>

    <p><b>The Mirakuru</b></p>

    <p>Months later, Oliver had noticeably improved in his combat tactics, as noted by both Slade and Shado. The three of them soon discovered another group of people on the island, and went to track them down. However, Shado was soon abducted by the group, forcing Oliver and Slade to try and rescue her. They soon found her being interrogated by a group of pirates, who were asking her where to find "bodies." Slade told Oliver to wait for his signal to attack, but Oliver, unable to watch Shado be tortured, attacked them impulsively. While Slade fended off the other pirates, Oliver brutally murdered their leader out of rage, shocking both Slade and Shado.</p>
    <p>Slade promptly suggested Shado talk to Oliver, worried that he would lose his mind. This leads to the latter two making love, to the clear annoyance of Slade, who told Oliver that Shado was simply a distraction that would lead to his death. The three of them soon found a cave with skeletal remains of Japanese soldiers from World War II,[7] determining that they were the very same bodies that the pirates were looking for. They also deduced that more people were likely to follow, and so they took one of the bodies back to the plane. As Shado examined the body, Slade and Oliver went to find a strategic point to watch from, if more pirates were to appear.</p>
    <p>Slade emphasized his point about Shado, though Oliver ignored him. When finally the two reached the top of a mountain, they discovered that the pirates had come from a large ship just off the coast of Lian Yu. They soon spotted a number of missiles coming from the ship, clearly aimed for their compound. Oliver and Slade raced back to the plane, however as soon as they approached, they were both knocked out by the explosion of missiles. Oliver quickly saw Slade some distance off with his hands and face on fire, then fainted.</p>
    <p>Oliver woke up sometime later, imprisoned in a cell, surrounded by several other people.[37] As he awoke, Oliver was approached by the surviving pirate that interrogated Shado. <a href="">The man</a> asked him who his friends were and whether any of them knew the location of the graves. Refusing to answer, the man gave him two options: he could give him answers, or he could be tortured, though both would ultimately end in death. Oliver obstinately refuses to reveal anything, and the man shot him in the stomach. Oliver was soon given tools and medicinal tools to remove the bullet. Oliver was prompted to ask a nearby prisoner, later revealed as <a href="">Anatoly Knyazev</a>, as to why the incident occurred. He explained that it was to see if he was strong enough to survive, and showed a scar from the identical injury.</p>
    <p>Oliver eventually removed the bullet, to immense pain, and the pirate soon came back to find Oliver surviving. The ship's captain asked him again if he knew of the location of the Japanese bodies and although Oliver didn't say a word, the captain inferred that they were in fact on the correct island. Later, the crew brought Oliver out of his cell, being told that his days of screaming had just begun. He was thrown in to a room, followed through the opposite door by a woman. Oliver sees that, much to his shock, the woman is <a href="">Sara Lance</a>, somehow having also survived their shipwreck.</p>
    <p>Oliver, surprised to see Sara alive, tried talking to her, but she quickly kicked him in the stomach, claiming that "prisoners don't speak." A man entered the room, introducing himself as <a href="">Ivo</a>, and asked for Oliver's name in return. Sara signaled to Oliver not to give his real name, so Oliver began to lie, firstly stating that his name was Tommy and secondly that he was the only survivor of a shipwreck that occurred near the island. When Ivo asked if he had come by a Japanese submarine while exploring the island, Oliver informed him that he hadn't. Ivo then revealed that during World War II, the Japanese created a serum called "<a href="">Mirakuru</a>" that increased the physical strength and allowed rapid cell regeneration in humans. He explained that the serum was transported via a submarine that came under heavy fire, running aground somewhere in the chain of islands containing Lian Yu, and it was finally thanks to Oliver that they knew it was Lian Yu itself. Oliver angrily told Ivo that he'd killed Oliver's friends, and Ivo replied, telling him that due to his friends being dead, it was up to Oliver to help Ivo find the sub. Later, Sara came to visit Oliver in his cell, advising him not to reveal their knowing each other, otherwise they would both be killed.</p>
    <p>Oliver wished to warn his friends, believing them to still be alive, so later that night, Sara unlocked Oliver's cell, telling him to follow her. As he left, the prisoner he previously talked to asked him to not forget about them, followed by Oliver promising that he would return. Sara brought him to a room with a radio transmitter inside it and showed him that she could operate it. Oliver called for his friends and Shado answered, but before he could reveal his location, Sara disconnected the radio. Ivo and the Captain entered the room, with Ivo revealing that Oliver has confirmed that his friends were alive, and thus still a threat, for which they would be killed. The Captain believed Oliver to be of no more use and pointed a gun towards his head. However, Sara interjected, stating that Oliver could still be useful. Ivo agreed, telling Oliver that he would be going back to the island and calling him by name, revealing that Sara had seemingly been manipulating him the whole time.</p>
    <p>Oliver was soon take back to the island and led to the plane wreck, where the Captain laid charges to blow up the compound. However, Shado was successfully able to diffuse the detonator in time, initially unbeknownst to them. As they reached the grave site of the Japanese soldiers, Ivo questioned Oliver about the <a href="">hōzen</a> he had previously found at the site. Oliver didn't reply, causing Ivo to get angry and send him outside to be tortured. As the captain was about to torture him, Shado and Slade appeared to save Oliver, shooting one of the men and grabbing Sara and Oliver before running away from Ivo and his men. Once they were a good distance away from Ivo, they stopped and Oliver mentioned the hōzen, which Shado kept as a pendant because it reminded her of her father. They realized that the etchings on one side of the hōzen were coordinates to the shipwrecked submarine, where the Mirakuru serum was being kept. When Sara explained that the serum could save the human race, Oliver asked her whether it could Slade, who was slowly dying due to his collective injuries from the previous missile explosions.</p>
    <p>Presumably agreeing that the serum could save Slade, the four of them began to trek through the island towards the inscribed coordinates. During their journey, Shado questioned Oliver on how he knew Sara and he admitted that she was <a href="">Laurel's sister</a>. Dismayed at his response, Shado began to distance herself from him. They eventually found the submarine and entered it, leaving a weakened Slade near the entrance to find the serum. When they did, Sara revealed that they needed to give Slade a sedative before injecting him with the serum, but another scan of the area revealed that there were no sedatives in the sub.</p>
    <p>Oliver made the decision to use the serum on Slade anyway, and before he was injected, Slade revealed that he had been in love with Shado the whole time she and Oliver were together. That said, Oliver gave him the serum, and he, Shado and Sara were horrified when it only seemed to kill him faster. Before they could begin to mourn Slade, Ivo and his men arrived, taking the three of them captive.[40] Once they collected the serum, Ivo had his men take them back up to the island, where Sara played on Ivo's affection for her to cajole him into letting Oliver and Shado go.</p>
    <p>But while Ivo admitted that he cared about her, he forced Oliver at gunpoint to choose who he wanted to live more, Sara or Shado. Given thirty seconds, Oliver tried to get Ivo to leave them alone but was forced to kneel behind Sara when Ivo moved to shoot her. Taking this as Oliver's decision, Ivo shoots Shado, causing Oliver to be overcome with shock and guilt. Slade suddenly appeared, attacking everyone standing. Ivo ran off, leaving his men to die, and when Slade discovered Shado's body and asked why she died, Sara lied because of Oliver and said that Ivo shot her without reason.</p>
    <p>Oliver, Slade and Sara later buried Shado next to Yao Fei and Robert Queen. During her funeral, Oliver stated his hope that she was with her father. Slade gave Oliver Shado's green hood, and initially he did not want it, but kept it after being reminded by Slade of their relationship prior to her death. Later as they were walking, Oliver was close to telling Slade the true reason why Shado was killed, when Sara approached him, advising him not to, as Slade still had Mirakuru in him, and they had no idea as to the effects of it. They asked Slade where they were headed and he responded that they were heading back to the plane, in order to get geared up before they killed Ivo and his men. Before Oliver could stop him from continuing his plan of killing Ivo, Slade lifted Oliver a foot off the ground, choking him. Sara promptly hit Slade with a branch, making him let go of Oliver and causing him to realize what he'd done. Oliver simply assumed that that the Mirakuru was messing with his head.</p>
    <p>Later that night, Ivo contacted them through a radio, telling them they had ten days to deliver the Mirakuru to him, in turn giving them safe passage off of the island. They turned to consult with Slade, only to realize that he had disappeared.[42] After a number of heart-to-heart conversations, Oliver and Sara made their way to the cave that they’d found the Japanese soldiers in. Slade was nowhere to be found, though Oliver spotted some calculations on a wall. He recognized them, telling Sara how he'd seen identical calculations on Edward Fyers' missile launcher. Oliver therefore deduced that Slade was going to destroy the Amazo with the missiles. The two rushed to the missile launchers as quick as they could and found Slade inputting the calculations.</p>
    <p>Oliver attempted to stop Slade, however he threatened to shoot him if he got in the way. Before he could, Oliver admitted that Shado had indeed loved Slade, perhaps not romantically but indeed platonically, and would have wanted him to return home. Knowing this, Slade decided not to fire, so as to not let Shado die in vain, and Oliver reassured him that he would help his friend along the difficult road.</p>
    <p>Once Slade had got his senses back, the three of them surveyed the freighter and brainstormed ideas on how to board it. As they were talking they heard a plane. When it came in to sight they began to make noise to signal it, though it was quickly shot down with a missile. They ran to find it and discovered its dying pilot. Sara suggested Oliver get medical supplies from their compound and so he and Slade went back to retrieve some, but they returned too late to save the man. In the midst of this, however, Oliver noticed a bagged parachute, remarking how it could get them on to the freighter.[44] For some time, Oliver trained around the forest, improving his archery and various strengths, progressively getting much better as time went by.</p>
    <p>Slade commended Oliver on his skills, though Oliver reminded him that trees were nothing compared to live enemies. He later discussed plans to attack the ship, while Sara concocted some cocculus indicus, to counteract sodium pentathol, which Sara assumed Ivo would use on Oliver. Outside, Oliver suggested destroying the Mirakuru, to which Slade overheard and agreed. While burning it, Sara explained that Oliver had to be the one to kill Ivo, not Slade, so there were no repercussions. Later that night, Slade produced some alcohol for the three of them, one of the few things that survived the plane's crash, and they drank to respective things. Oliver asked for Sara to reassure his mother of his moral changes, should he have died the following day, and she agreed. Slade suggested they get some rest and Oliver soon went to sleep. Through the night, Oliver had nightmares.</p>
    <p>He woke up to Sara and Slade ready to go and donned Shado's old hood. They trekked to a hill on the shoreline and Oliver prepared to shoot a flaming arrow at a bonfire they’d built. He initially failed the first time but hit it point blank the second. Slade remarked that they were leaving the island as brothers (in contrast to them meeting as strangers) and Oliver bid him farewell. Down on the shore, two of Ivo's men spotted Oliver. He began to run along the beach, only to trip over a tree root and be captured by the men. On the ship, Oliver was placed back into a cell. He began talking to a man who introduced himself as Thomas Flynn. Not long after, Ivo summoned Oliver to his room. Refusing to answer Ivo's questions, Oliver was injected with sodium pentathol or truth serum. Seemingly dazed, Oliver began to answer Ivo's questions and apparently reveal their entire plan.</p>
    <p>He was taken back to his cell, but along the way he knocked the guards out and took their keys. Oliver rendezvoused with Sara and Slade outside and was given his bow and arrows. They let the prisoners go and Oliver made his way to Ivo. Aiming an arrow at him, Oliver blamed Ivo for Shado's death. Ivo tried to explain how it was, in fact, Oliver's fault. When Oliver finally admitted his feelings of guilt, he threatened to kill Ivo, however, Ivo alerted him to Slade's presence in the room, and he turned to face a horrified Slade. Oliver finally admitted to Shado's death being his fault and Slade began to fight him, letting Ivo escape. Before Slade could choke him to death, there was an explosion that sent Slade flying. Oliver took the chance to run, jumping off the side of the ship just after Anatoly, Thomas and Sara, only to be grabbed by the ankle by Slade. Slade then put him in a cell, announcing that he was the new captain of the Amazo, after killing the previous one.</p>
    <p>Later, Slade ordered Oliver to be brought out. He gave Ivo a gun, asking him to kill Oliver just as he had killed Shado. When he did not do it straight away, Slade sliced his arm off. Ivo was taken away, and Slade claimed that he would not let Oliver die until he had known complete despair, as Slade had, reassuring and promising him that it would eventually come.</p>
    <p>While in custody, Slade had Oliver severely tortured by the ship's crew, zapping him with electricity before finally branding him with the same tattoo that Shado had.[46] Later as part of an exchange deal between Slade and Sara, Oliver was returned to the island with Ivo in exchange for Hendrick, a former cellmate of Oliver's. Oliver intervened when Slade aimed his gun at Sara, and Slade predicted that they would spend the rest of their life on the island, before leaving. As he left, he threatened that once he had the ship moving, he would go to make Oliver's family suffer.</p>
    <p>A little while after, Oliver was being attended to by Sara for his heavily damaged eye, after being punched by Slade. Anatoly attempted to torture Anthony Ivo, only to be stopped before he could. Ivo proceeded to tell Oliver that there was, in fact, a cure to the Mirakuru, a possible way to stop Slade. Ivo offered to help them find it if they could provide him with a quick death due to the gangrene traveling in his system due to his arm stump. They agreed to the deal and after being told where the cure was, Oliver shot Ivo, as a way to protect Sara from having to be the one to do it.[48] Anatoly, <a href="">Peter</a> (another former prisoner), Sara and Oliver all returned to the Japanese submarine.</p>
    <p>Oliver suggested to Anatoly that he pilot the submarine, having been in the Russian Navy, and he reluctantly agreed. When they tried, they were unable to get away. Oliver suggested they blast their way out, so Anatoly retrieved blueprints for the ship's torpedoes. However, it became apparent that the torpedoes could only be directed by someone in there with them, therefore whoever directed it would die. Peter was quick to volunteer, pointing out that he had inevitably fatal radiation poisoning, and it was a generally heroic action as he would be saving a number of lives. Anatoly soon directed Peter as to what would be happening while Oliver instructed Sara to wait outside for his call.</p>
    <p>Oliver came to talk with Peter before he prepared himself, and Peter remarked that he believed Oliver would be particularly compassionate one day. The two shook hands and Peter got into the torpedo hole. After Sara was clear, they fired the torpedo. As it directed back and hit the submarine, the two were knocked off their feet. Oliver was able to stand back up, moving the submarine around.</p>
    <p>Successful, Oliver proceeded to notify Sara, only for her to desperately shout his name through the radio.[49] Oliver went above the submarine to find Sara and returned with her walkie talkie, concluding that Slade's men had taken her. Anatoly mentioned that he'd seen the Amazo moving, so Oliver suggested that they fire a torpedo right at it. He decided that he'd swim across if they could get close enough. This confused Anatoly who asked what the torpedo was for. Oliver requested that he fire it at the Amazo if he and Sara were not back within an hour, much to the shock of Anatoly.</p>
    <p>When they got close, Oliver and Anatoly said farewell to each other, the latter remarking that the former had made a lifelong friend, warranting any favors happily given. They hugged, Anatoly promising he'd teach Oliver Russian, and Oliver hurried up the ladder and out towards the Amazo. He sneaked aboard and opened Sara's cell. He made her leave without him, explaining his plan to cure Slade's Mirakuru, though she refused and they both made their way to Ivo's quarters.</p>
    <p>Before Oliver could go for the Mirakuru cure, they were ambushed by Slade who revealed that he had the cure.[50] Slade took Oliver and Sara to watch him inject numerous prisoners with Mirakuru, though it had clearly failed on several already. Oliver tried to reason with Slade, stating how Shado would have wanted them both to survive and return home. Before Slade could shoot Oliver, Anatoly fired the torpedo at the Amazo. The ship began to flood and Oliver grabbed an arrow, killing Slade's men where he could. Before Slade could grab the Mirakuru, Oliver was able to, however, he was able to grab Sara. Slade threw Sara down the hole in the ship, seemingly killing her again.</p>
    <p>The two started to fight and soon Slade was able to lift up Oliver by choking him. Oliver took off Slade's mask, but Slade simply knocked him down. As Oliver stood up, they started to run at each other, but they were knocked off balance and large bits of debris fell on to Slade, trapping him. Being given a choice between curing or killing, Oliver decided to kill Slade by stabbing an arrow through his eye. A further explosion knocked Oliver over. A day or two later, Oliver awoke in a bed. Two men in suits ordered him to follow them, and once outside Oliver was greeted by <a href="">Amanda Waller</a>, who revealed that he was in Hong Kong.</p>

    <p><b>Working for A.R.G.U.S.</b></p>

    <p>Over the next five months, Oliver made a large number of attempts to contact friends and family, but he was finally stopped by <a href="">Maseo Yamashiro</a> after trying to email his mother, informing her of his survival. He was taken to <a href="">Waller</a>, who threatened to kill him if he escaped, though Oliver didn't care. Considering this, Maseo was given custody of Oliver, threatening to kill his entire family if Oliver did not comply. Shortly after, Oliver was tasked to execute a target, to which Oliver was shocked to see his best friend, <a href="">Tommy Merlyn</a>, through his scope. Oliver quickly learned that Tommy was in Hong Kong due to an account alert going off when Oliver logged into his email account. Maseo told Oliver that Tommy needed to be "off the board" as Waller couldn't risk Tommy flashing his picture all over the place. Oliver would suggest to Maseo that they could find a Tommy Merlyn look-a-like at a local morgue but Maseo reasoned that it would be easier winning the lottery and paying Waller off.</p>
    <p>Oliver decided to kidnap his best friend, telling Tommy that he hacked Oliver's account hoping his mother or sister would come to Hong Kong in search for him. He told Tommy that he was more than happy that Tommy came, as he's the son of the CEO of <a href="">Merlyn Global Group</a>. He threatened that Tommy pay a ransom or he would join Oliver, before Maseo intervened as a police officer and "rescued" him. Days later, Oliver was tasked to kill a "terrorist" which Oliver believed didn't look like one. Maseo told Oliver that those were the best terrorists and ordered Oliver to proceed to kill him. Oliver proceeded to kill the man in the open though and due to the crowd, it went unnoticed, as Oliver retrieved a USB which Waller required to be acquired.</p>
    <p>At Maseo's home, Oliver questioned what it was needed for, though Maseo refused to answer. While Maseo was busy, Oliver convinced Akio to lend the laptop, to which Oliver plugged in the USB and learned the man he was sent to kill was Edward Fyers' handler. Oliver requested a meeting with Waller as he realized she was the true perpetrator behind the attempted shooting of the Ferris air jet. Oliver learned from Waller that the true reason why she wanted the plane shot down was to eliminate Chien Na Wei, as it was their only opportunity. Sometime later Oliver and Maseo waited in a street for an hour (after having also circled the block five times) Maseo updated Oliver as to who their target was, telling him that he only needed to get information and not kill him. They spotted the man and Oliver attempted to inconspicuously follow him. However, the man was able to knock him down as he ran off.</p>
    <p>Oliver began to run after him, stopped by various roadblocks he had caused. As he rounded a corner, the man was struck down by a car. Maseo caught up, trying to find the envelope they were looking for on his person, though he concluded that it had been stashed on the way. He reasoned that Oliver mightn't consciously remember, but likely still saw him stash it. They headed back to Maseo's apartment, where <a href="">Akio</a> helped Oliver to concentrate with a game. The game was interrupted by <a href="">Tatsu</a>, who offered her help upon encouragement from her husband.</p>
    <p>She sat opposite him, lighting a candle, instructing him to close his eyes and breath deeply, trying to recall the memory. From this exercise, Oliver remembered what he needed to. At the dead drop, they found the envelope, inside a random photo. Initially confused, Maseo explained that it was concealing a hidden message. They examined the image with a computer and came across the message, "Contact <a href="">Li Khuan Hui</a>". Oliver thanked Tatsu, who simply asked for him to leave their lives as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>Days later, Oliver was attempting to learn Cantonese as Tatsu angrily brought him his washing, and he claimed to not know how to do it. Maseo began to leave, explaining that he had a contact at the docks but a "gaijin" like Oliver would stick out, so he couldn't accompany him. However, after he didn't return 9 hours later (claiming he'd only be 1), Oliver and Tatsu decided to go searching down at the docks. They headed to the docks, where Tatsu explained that Maseo had called him a foreigner (gaijin in Japanese) Oliver decided to go and ask some men if they'd seen Maseo, though they began to beat him up. Tatsu intervened, killing them all with a katana. She questioned a man with the katana at his neck and he claimed to have heard of three <a href="">A.R.G.U.S.</a> men being killed by the <a href="">Triad</a>. Heading back to the apartment, Tatsu worried about having to tell Akio what had happened. As they entered they happened upon Maseo playing with Akio.</p>
    <p>Tatsu ran to embrace him and he had explained how they'd been in lockdown due to the A.R.G.U.S. deaths. Oliver watched on as the entire family embraced, and soon went to do his laundry. Following that, Oliver was taken by Waller to a warehouse, where she introduced a tied up Katsu Chang, who had planted a bomb somewhere in Hong Kong. Waller revealed that they'd salvaged Oliver's old bow and arrow from the <a href="">Amazo</a>'s wreckage, and she asked Oliver to torture out the location of the explosive device.</p>
    <p>He pointed the bow and arrow at Chang, though he suggested correctly that Oliver wasn't keen on actually torturing a man. In wasting this time, a massive explosion occurred in the city, which Oliver witnessed. Angered, Waller lectured Oliver, reasoning that extreme people could only be dealt with using extreme measures, therefore he should have just shot an arrow instead of waiting. Allowing him to make an attempt at redemption, Waller brought him Li Khuan Hui, asking him to torture him for details on <a href="">Chien Na Wei</a>'s agenda in Hong Kong. Waller left, allowing Oliver to get ready his bow.</p>
    <p>Oliver returned to Maseo's apartment after his torture of Li Khuan Hui. He was handed food but claimed to have no appetite. He revealed what he'd learned from his torture, that a biotechnology company had created a super-virus, <a href="">Omega</a> when initially attempting to create a super-antibiotic, and that one vial could wipe out an entire city. Following that, the two men headed to the initial company, <a href="">BTHK Biotech</a>. Maseo headed off to watch the security footage.</p>
    <p>Unable to find any vials of it, Oliver told Maseo, who checked recent footage, finding a scientist from the inside who'd stolen it for Chien Na Wei. They found the man, who claimed to have absolutely no knowledge of what they were talking about. Getting no answers, Oliver threatened him with a bow and arrow. After much torture, they were confused as to how he would not confess. Maseo finally suggested that he was perhaps under the influence of a hypnotic drug called <a href="">Vitura</a>. They decided that as they had Chien's "inside man," their biggest problem could have been her finding them. They returned to Maseo's apartment, finding blood on some paper and Akio, claiming that the "white-haired woman" had taken Tatsu.</p>
    <p>Oliver and Maseo took their concerns to Waller who told them of the second half other the virus, <a href="">Alpha</a>, and ordered Oliver and Maseo to retrieve it, and was noticeably unconcerned with Tatsu's disappearance. On the rooftop of the nearby building, Maseo compromised the glass and Oliver attempted to grapple by arrow into the building. However, he got stuck and almost fell to his death, before eventually getting in. Once in, he, Maseo and other agents engaged the Triad but Oliver used this chance to discreetly plant a tracker on one of them and let him get away. Oliver later explained his reasoning to Maseo, wishing to have the man lead him to Maseo's wife.</p>
    <p>Maseo expressed his gratitude and told him he would forever be in his debt. The Yamashiro's decided to go to Shanghai, to escape from China White. As Oliver made his attempts to call home, Amanda's men capture him and tortured him to uncover Maseo's location. Later on, Maseo is captured and revealed that being captured was his plan all along, and him going to Shanghai was a lie. The two are then knocked out cold. They later wake up in a car where Amanda revealed China White has fled Hong Kong. Oliver was then shocked to find himself back home in Starling City, where they had tracked Chien Na Wei.</p>
    <p>Oliver was briefed, learning that an executive was in town, Peter Khang, a man who worked for <a href="">Queen Consolidated</a>. Oliver recognized Khang because he'd been over at the Queen's household for <a href="">Christmas</a>. Waller gave Oliver strict orders not to make any contact with family or friends, or she would kill them off. Oliver began to keep a watchful eye over Thea from a distance, learning Thea had begun a drug addiction, much to his dismay.</p>
    <p>That night, Oliver snuck into his family's company, hacking into Peter Khang's computer. Oliver then found files from his father that were intended for him and his sister. As he was uploading the files to the computer, Felicity Smoak walked in, though Oliver managed to hide in time. While Maseo and Waller were tracking down the location of the OMEGA auction, Oliver snuck off to Tommy's party. After watching Jordan Kern selling drugs to his sister once again, he approached him, threatening him to stay away from Thea. When Jordan noticed his identity, Oliver shoved him and told him to stay away once again. Jordan pulled a knife, though Oliver snapped his neck and threw him off the balcony. Maseo then found Oliver and told him they found the location of the auction. Oliver told Maseo he needs to return home and fix what's broken since he left. Maseo reminded Oliver that thousands could die if they don't stop the auction but Oliver told Maseo he doesn't care for those people.</p>
    <p>Oliver returned home, though no one was there. Oliver used a tablet to view the file sent to him. He listened to his father's message to him, a similar one that his father gave him before he committed suicide. Motivating, him, Oliver came to assist Maseo in stopping the auction. The following day, Oliver thanked Waller for the ride home, though to his disappointment, General Matthew Shrieve required him to be debriefed back in Hong Kong. After Oliver explained several times what happened, Matthew released Oliver, Maseo and his family from A.R.G.U.S and let them go anywhere in the world. As Oliver, Maseo and his family walked to the boat, an engineer walked by and began shooting at Oliver, Maseo and his family. Oliver, confused, ran to cover along with Maseo and his family. Maseo debunked that Waller didn't like General Matthew's decision, and it would be better if she had them killed. While running to the boat, Maseo told Oliver to take Akio and run, while Maseo protected his wife.</p>
    <p>Oliver took Akio and ran. While on the run from Waller's men, Oliver and Akio ran into <a href="">Mei</a>, Shado's twin sister.</p>
    <p>Oliver requested her help as she hid them in her house. Oliver lied that his name was Tommy, and he knew Shado in medical school. However, his lies were revealed as Mei saw Oliver's dragon tattoo on his back, the same tattoo Shado had. Before Oliver is given the chance to explain, Waller's men began shooting. The men stormed in, but Masao and Tatsu arrived in time to take down the remaining men. Oliver then revealed Shado and Yao Fei's fate to Mei, and she thanked him for telling her the truth. Still, on the run from A.R.G.U.S., Maseo had them all stay at a run-down residence with an acquaintance, Li Ling who was in debt to them. While Waller's men were looking for them all over Hong Kong, Maseo told Oliver they'd be found even if they'd left the city.</p>
    <p>Oliver decided to "find Waller first." He infiltrated the main field office with Maseo's pass-card to the main office. He was then cornered by a man who was shot from behind by an injured Waller. She informed Oliver that she'd been usurped, and had been kept hostage there for weeks. She dropped her gun, allowing herself to be held at gunpoint by Oliver. She then told Oliver it was general Shrieve who targeted them for death, not her and that he planned to distribute and unleash the <a href="">Alpha-Omega bioweapon</a> all over Hong Kong; as he believed China to be an economic threat and pin it on the Triad. He also learned from her his men developed a vaccine so he and his men don't die along with all of Hong Kong. She warned him to run, to get as far away from Hong Kong as he can. He later returned to the Yamashiros and conversed with them.</p>
    <p>Maseo warned them Shrieve had Waller's resources and his contacts said he had men all over Hong Kong. Oliver proposed they steal some of the vaccines. They broke into a supposed army base and successfully found the vaccine and manage to make it out. Oliver also stole a phone which was revealed to have plans for how the virus was going to be distributed.</p>
    <p>After the three of them and Akio were all inoculated, Oliver decided he would stop the virus from spreading. He told Maseo and Tatsu to take Akio and get out of Hong Kong. Tatsu replied that she and Maseo would help him. Oliver protested, but she replied that he needs to learn to let people help him. Oliver, Maseo, and Tatsu later located General Shrieve and his men. They looked on as the Alpha and Omega components were mixed and the virus armed. Oliver also noted a food cart was at the scene, thinking they were having dinner. They followed a truck supposedly carrying the virus leaving the area in a car Oliver "borrowed."</p>
    <p>Down the road, they were spotted and a gunfight ensued. Oliver and Tatsu managed to commandeer the truck and searched it but the virus wasn't there. Tatsu interrogated a soldier for the virus' actual whereabouts. He replied the virus was actually in the food cart seen earlier. They tracked down the cart and another firefight ensued. While Maseo and Tatsu dispatched the rest of the soldiers, Oliver managed to snatch the vial containing the bioweapon but he was engaged in combat with the soldier handing the phial out, and in the struggle, the phial fell through the air and shattered over the ground and the bioweapon was released. Very little time later, multiple civilians were already immediately infected, dying and a public announcement was made.</p>
    <p>Oliver was guilt-ridden as he'd had the phial in his hand, but Maseo told him it wasn't his fault, it was that of General Shrieve. After Tatsu says she couldn't get through to Li Ling who was watching Akio, they decided to regroup and head back. In the later morning, they came across an Army truck that was supposedly handing out a cure for the supposed chemical attack, but the three of them figured out what was actually being handed out was the virus.</p>
    <p>Oliver walked up to the van, firing off his gun, scaring off the crowd, the three of them dispatched the soldiers and Oliver angrily stated "all of it" destroyed. Setting off a bomb, the truck imploded supposedly destroying all of the bioweapon. However, unbeknownst to Oliver, Maseo had secretly stole a sample intending to use it on Shrieve for revenge. They immediately ran back to Li Ling's apartment, and gathered Akio but Li Ling was found dead from the virus. Oliver told them both that the chaos will give them cover from general Shrieve, so they decided to leave Hong Kong. After hotwiring a car, they began to set off, unfortunately, Akio was bleeding from his mouth and was feverish - he'd been infected. Later on in the day, Oliver and the Yamashiros had arrived at a pharmacy to find something to help Akio. Maseo had surmised that Akio's immune system wasn't strong enough for the vaccine due to his young age. Out of desperation, he surmised that maybe Shrieve and his men had made a cure, but he had to try. Oliver decided to come along with him.</p>
    <p>Oliver managed to locate a "rogue Army base" and the both of them stormed through the base, killing their way through to General Shrieve. Maseo shot him in the shoulder. Shrieve relented pointing to a safe, but the cure had to be administered subcutaneously. Oliver roughed Shrieve saying he was coming with them to administer it. With Shrieve held hostage, they made their way back to the pharmacy. Unfortunately, Akio was already dead. Shrieve revealed he had played them revealing "the cure" was insulin for his diabetes. His intention was to learn their location and he'd had soldiers following them all along and laser sights were immediately pointed at them.[52] Oliver, out of rage, attacked Shrieve catching him off guard, pummeling him to a pulp, while Maseo shot the incoming soldiers. Oliver subdued Shrieve burrowing an arrow in his leg.</p>
    <p>Three days later, the bioweapon had been contained. Akio's body had been burned with his ashes held in three metal containers. In revenge, Oliver returned to the pharmacy where he was holding Shrieve and, using his arrows and all the tools he got his hands on, tortured Shrieve for hours until the general was unconscious. Maseo and Tatsu came back and Tatsu was horrified by what Shrieve had done but Oliver simply stated that he'd "failed this city" and Maseo shot Shrieve dead. Oliver looked on and listened as Maseo left Tatsu.</p>
    <p>Oliver met with Tatsu at the port. He told her he wasn't going back to Starling City, because of his torture of Shrieve and he didn't want that darkness around his sister and mother, and said that he "needs to be alone". Oliver gave Tatsu a hug, wished her well and boarded a ship for Coast City.</p>
    
    <p><b>Returning to Lian Yu</b></p>

    <p>Oliver spent some time as a hooded vigilante, targeting corrupted businessmen at random. At one night, while pursuing an armed man who was responsible for the death of 5 people, 4 of them children, Oliver ran into Amanda Waller. She said Oliver needed to embrace the killer instinct he used to torture <a href="">Shrieve</a>.</p>
    <p>Waller then drugged Oliver and forced him back on Lian Yu to infiltrate a <a href="">drug lord</a>'s cartel. Shortly after landing, Oliver was found by one of the men but easily killed him. He then dirtied his clothes and threw the man's body over a landmine to make it look like he had been stranded the entire three years he was missing and that the man accidentally stepped on a landmine.</p>
    <p>He easily infiltrated their ranks due to the dead man leaving a vacant position for Oliver to take.[53] He was later forced to torture a slave to psychologically torture the other prisoners who had stolen the drug. After a woman called <a href="">Taiana Venediktov</a> took the blame of the stealing, Oliver was tasked to execute her. Instead, he took her elsewhere to hide her somewhere safe but was accompanied by one other man. This forced Oliver to trick him into stepping onto a landmine, gradually gaining Taiana's trust. After showing to <a href="">Conklin</a> he "killed" Taiana, Conklin found out Oliver's communication device and started accusing him as a spy.</p>
    <p>When they returned to Baron Reiter, he was interrogating a man called <a href="">John Constantine</a> about the maps he had. Before anyone could do anything, John made a spell to escape from handcuffs and took Oliver to show him the spot on the maps. After he took John there, John sought and performed a spell to uncover the hidden passageway, much to Oliver's shock. Once inside, they explored the cave where John explained that there are areas of the world as old as it including Lian Yu, possessing things corrupt men aren't supposed to have such as Reiter.</p>
    <p>John eventually found what he sought and retrieved it but set off a trap which Oliver saves him from being killed by, insisting he's not one of Reiter's men. After exiting the cave John thanked Oliver for saving his life and broke off the crystal off the rod to give to Reiter, as the rod itself is what contains the magic. John also warned Oliver about Reiter, insisting his narcotics aren't his only interest for being on the island. As insurance John also used the rod to transfer a spell on his arm onto Oliver's torso, insisted he'd know what to do when the time came and on Oliver's request, John punched him out cold as part of his "escape" and left on his boat, but the two would keep in contact.</p>
    <p>After Oliver took Reiter and Conklin to the cave, where he and John found the Orb of Horus, Reiter tasked Oliver to find out the spot the runes told him about with some workers. Conklin went with him and tasked Taiana's brother <a href="">Vlad</a> to drown Oliver. Oliver managed to kill him before that and he went back to Reiter with Conklin. Baron Reiter managed to find out the truth from Conklin and after they went away, Oliver stole a map him. He then punished Conklin by whipping him and went to Taiana with the maps and news about her brother. He encouraged Taiana to help him stop Reiter, by first going to <a href=""><i>Amazo</i></a>, to find maps that covered the whole Lian Yu. He fought with a shark after diving to get the maps, but after coming back to land, Conklin appeared, promising to enjoy taking pieces out of him. Conklin then took Oliver and Taiana to Reiter, and let Conklin to whip Oliver as a payback.</p>
    <p>Before Conklin could kill Oliver, his tattoo's started to glow near Orb of Horus and Reiter made Conklin to stop. Oliver made a deal with Reiter, as long as Taiana would stay alive, he would cooperate. Conklin took them to an old Chinese cell where they kept the prisoners and there Taiana started to heal Oliver from his fever and wounds.</p>
    <p>Reiter would then torture Oliver to find out why he needed the maps from Amazo. Oliver passed out from the torture and the fever and hallucinated that Shado would kill Reiter, his men and save him. Shado encouraged Oliver to let go of his inner darkness and tell the truth about Vlad to Taiana. After waking up from the fever, Oliver told the truth about Vlad to Taiana and noticed he had the artifact in his hand from the hallucination. Taiana took the artifact from him and tried to use it as leverage to get out from the cell. Reiter took the artifact from her and forced her to take care of Oliver.</p>
    <p>She did that and they started talking about the losses in their life. Taiana told him that he could be the man his father wishes, by saving the workers from Reiter, but couldn't do that as lost, shattered man. Oliver promised her that he would save the workers. Baron Reiter later informed Oliver and Taiana that the stone was the last piece to his puzzle and they will dig at daybreak as the Heaven he seeks is below them.</p>
    <p>Oliver conspired with the Slam cultivators to kill Conklin in order to prove that he was there to save them and take out Reiter. After Conklin was left alone watching over Oliver when Reiter departed from his office, he noticed Oliver attempting to stab him through his reflection in the mirror and engaged in a fight, vowing to kill Taiana after he is done with Oliver. During the fight, Oliver stabbed Conklin in the chest as he warned Oliver that Reiter was going to kill everyone on the island before dying. The following day a passage is discovered that leads to Reiter's desired "ultimate power" but a primordial energy takes the form of the deceased Conklin, standing in front of the cave entrance and spoke in tongues that everyone was going to die.</p>
    <p>After Reiter left Taiana and Oliver alone in the room the force, noticing the spell on Oliver's torso, deemed him worthy to pass before disappearing. In the depths of the cave, Oliver, Taiana, Reiter and two of his mercenaries, finally succeed in finding the <a href="">Khushu Idol</a>, a mystical object that allows the user to tap in to the power of dark magic harnessing him enhanced physical attributes and psychic abilities by killing others. Oliver steals it and runs off into the tunnels with Taiana followed by Reiter's mercenaries, which they managed to incapacitate acquiring their guns. However, the path they took lead nowhere so they had to return to the cave where they came from. Reiter waited them there and due to the Idol, he was empowered by the deaths of his mercenaries and managed to defeat Oliver when he tried to fight him.</p>
    <p>His powers soon vanished and Oliver took the opportunity to knock him out and rushed to Taiana who was unconscious. While Oliver checked on Taiana, Reiter managed to disappear meanwhile with the idol. Taiana started to have second thoughts to kill Reiter's men while looking and old picture of her and Vlad. Oliver encouraged her again, telling that he used to watch picture of Laurel to remember who he once was, but stopped since he wouldn't survive on Lian Yu and neither would Taiana by being the person they once were. Coming back to the prison side, Taiana tricked Reiter's men to the caves where Oliver shot them and distracted the remaining ones while Taiana free the prisoners. They armed themselves to kill all Reiter's mercenaries and trapped Reiter in the caves. While having a brief break, Oliver showed Laurel's picture to Taiana, and they both promised to each other that if one of them wouldn't survive, the other would go to his/her loved ones and tell what happened on the island.</p>
    <p>While coming back to the surface, the island had changed to a warzone between the armed prisoners and Reiter's men. Oliver took his communication gear that Conklin had taken and more weapons to fight Reiter. He told the others to go to the plane while leaving himself to fight Reiter. A few hours later, Reiter came to the surface empowered by the idol even more and while Oliver tried helplessly to fight him, Reiter's powers made him too powerful while Oliver's efforts being too "mortal".</p>
    <p>With the help of Taiana, Oliver managed to keep Reiter down by shooting constantly with an assault rifle, while Taiana took the idol with her. They ran to the forest but after wandering in the forest for few hours, the idol started to affect Taiana, giving her powers while also corrupting her. Continuing their journey, two of Reiter's men found them and shot Oliver and Taiana. While Oliver was pushed back, Taiana was unfazed and mercenaries death made her even more powerful and corrupt. Oliver tried to talk her out of using the Idol too much, but Taiana didn't listen to him. They found some prisoners fighting mercenaries and after taking them out, Taiana wanted to kill a harmed prisoner, since it would make her more powerful. Oliver tried again to talk some sense to her, but she didn't listen and threw Oliver away. He then took the idol from her, claiming that she would have to kill him if she wanted it back. However Reiter appeared, claiming to kill them both.</p>
    <p>While they started to fight, Reiter destroyed the plane that the prisoners had used to escape the island, empowering him and Taiana even more. However, Taiana managed to suck Reiter's life-force and make him vulnerable. Oliver then threw a knife to his back, killing Reiter. Taiana managed to take control of herself and pledged Oliver to kill her before she kills everyone on the island and becomes worse than Reiter; Oliver fulfills her wish and the prisoners saw him, claiming he is a killer. Oliver however, manages to talk them down and calls on Amanda Waller and A.R.G.U.S. to save them.</p>
    <p>After they had come, Amanda says how the mission was never to make Oliver reject his inner darkness but to put him through it and show how sometimes killing can be the only option there is. She tries to recruit Oliver for different missions across the globe but he rejects, saying he has to keep his promise to Taiana.</p>
    
    <p><b>Hunting Konstantin Kovar</b></p>

    <p>Due to the promise he made to Taiana, Oliver traveled to Russia to try and find <a href="">Konstantin Kovar</a>. He fought in an underground fight club connected to Kovar, where he ended up killing the local Bratva champion. In retaliation, the Bratva kidnapped him and tried to kill him. Before he could get shot, Oliver was saved by <a href="">Anatoly Knyazev</a>. When Oliver confessed his plans to him, Anatoly told him that the only way to get Kovar was getting the help from Bratva.[55] That meant that Oliver had to become a member, going through a very dangerous process. Oliver accepted and passed the three steps of the initiation, becoming a member of <a href="">Solntsevskaya Bratva</a>. After being accepted by the Bratva bosses in <a href="">Krasnoyarsk</a>, Oliver became a full-time member, nicknamed "Kapot".</p>
    <p><a href="">Viktor</a>, another high-ranking member of the Bratva still disliked Oliver, considering him an outsider and tried to have him killed at the following party at <a href="">Cafe Lyublyu</a> by goading the American into a trap, a staged rape attempt by his two thugs. Oliver was saved by <a href="">Christopher Chance</a> AKA Human Target, who was hired by Anatoly on the belief that Oliver was still in danger. After an attack from Kovar, Oliver was send by the <a href="">godfather</a> of the Bratva on an undercover mission to destroy one of his casinos. Oliver was discover and Kovar men's tortured him for an entire week. Oliver did not break, forcing Kovar admiration. He invited him at his table, revealing that Taiana's mother was one of his employees. Oliver tried to escape by taking Kovar hostage but he was too weak to do so and end up challenging him into a fight in front of his men. Oliver was incapable of keeping up with the fight and Kovar beat him violently.</p>
    <p>Just as the fight finished, Bratva men appear, revealing that they made a deal with Kovar while Oliver was prisoner. Kovar use this to taunt Oliver about the nature of truth and loyalty, mocking his naivety about the Bratva and their business.</p>
    <p>Outraged, Oliver told Bratva Pakhan Ishmael Gregor that his deal with Kovar betrayed the organization, the latter responding that his decisions were law and offered him a choice between swearing loyalty to him or dying. Oliver refused, but before Gregor could kill him, <a href="">Talia al Ghul</a> intervened, saving Oliver's life.</p>
    <p>She took and had him recover at her place, before she offered to help Oliver take down Kovar by targeting <a href="">Misha Yurievich</a>, who happened to be Kovar's primary revenue. Oliver accepted Talia's help and they raided and killed Yurievich and his men. Upon returning to their hideout, Talia reminded Oliver that his father has left him a list of "all the Kovar" of his city and that he had to set a mission for himself to make them pay, telling him that he had to come to terms with the monster inside him, as she presented him with a <a href="">green hood and suit</a>, along with a bow.</p>
    <p>Later, Talia helped Oliver to track down and kill <a href="">Hideo Yamane</a>, an individual on his father's list and one of the main drug lords of Starling City, while he was in Russia for his business. After this, she encouraged him to talk to Anatoly in order to leave Bratva and go back to his city to begin his mission; however, after Oliver discovered that Pakhan Gregor had Anatoly severely beaten just because he disagreed on his deal with Kovar, he proposed to his friend a plot to kill the Pakhan. However, before the two could decide their moves, Gregor and his men attacked them in the hospital where Anatoly had recovered. As they were about to be killed, Anatoly invoked the "spros dopros", a Bratva trial in which the Pakhan is asked to answer for his deeds. Before the process, Oliver broke into Kovar's home finding evidence of Gregor's corruption, therefore the majority of the Bratva captains decided to vote for Anatoly as the new Pakhan; then Gregor's men opened fire on them starting a mutiny.</p>
    <p>After the shootout most of the captains are killed and Gregor escaped with some of his men intending to promote new captains loyal to him; however Oliver, dressed in his green suit, and Anatoly, attacked Gregor during the meeting with his loyal Bratva members. After a confrontation on a hockey rink, Oliver managed to stop Gregor, badly injuring him. Before passing, <a href="">Gregor</a> reveal to Anatoly that <a href="">Kovar</a> was planning a coup to overthrow the Russian government. As the Hood, Oliver attack a shipment containing sarin gas destined to Kovar and torture one of his men to gain information. He learned that Kovar was planning to use the gas in his casino to kill government officials and military. He attacked the casino with the help of the Bratva, freeing them after they got betrayed by Viktor and preventing the gas from leaking.</p>
    <p>He confronted Kovar in a single fight, seemingly killing him. As a reward Anatoly granted him with the title of Bratva captain, and the <a href=""> black sun tattoo</a>. Oliver then asked Anatoly if he could get transportation back to Lian Yu, as it was the one alibi that could explain why he had been gone so long. Anatoly asked him to reconsider, wanting him to become a full-time Bratva member. After Oliver refused the request, Anatoly asked him to visit a hospital with him. They saw many sick children and Anatoly revealed that he wanted to steal medicine from a warehouse to help the kids and have their faith in the Bratva. This heist would also act as a goodbye celebration for the both of them. After stealing and distributing the medication, Anatoly once again tried to persuade Oliver to stay. Again, he kindly rejected the offer. Anatoly relented, wondering what he would become without Oliver at his side.</p>
    <p>Oliver and Anatoly returned to Lian Yu together to enact Oliver's plan to be found there. Upon the shore, he found Slade Wilson's mask and impaled it with an arrow, believing that it was a sign. He then bring Anatoly to the graves of all the people he buried on the island, explaining why he has to complete his mission, once he will return home. Before leaving, Anatoly tells him that he bribe some fishermen to come to the island in 48h to rescue him and made it look like it was just a coincidence that they found him. He also gave him a fake beard and wig from one of his KGB's friend to further complete his story as a castaway. Just after Oliver set up his bonfire, he was taken down by Kovar and his men, telling him that he is going to miss his boat home.</p>
    <p>Oliver was brought to Reiter's old prison. When he woke up, he asked Kovar how he survived, and Kovar simply replied that nothing really dies. Kovar then injected Oliver with an interrogation drug right where his Bratva tattoo was. Oliver then told Kovar that after he will kill him, he'll make sure he's dead. However, Kovar told him that later he will want to kill himself. Kover then said that pain is not a new experience for Oliver, and when Oliver asked him to stop wasting his time, Kovar touched Oliver's scars, and Oliver suddenly had flashbacks of the time he got them: after Yao Fei shot him 5 years prior, when he was tortured by Billy Wintergreen in 2007 and when he was whipped by Conklin.</p>
    <p>Oliver was then brought to a cell, and Kovar told him that the drug makes him remember the times he did something wrong. As Kover talked, Oliver had flashbacks of him killing Taiana, of Ivo killing Shado, and of him torturing General Shrieve. Kovar then gave him a gun with only 1 bullet, and presented him with a choice: to kill himself or to kill Kovar. Oliver didn't shoot Kovar, so he left to give him the choice.</p>
    <p>Oliver then started to hallucinate Yao Fei, who told him that he deserve to die. Oliver realized that Yao Fei is not really there, and pointed the gun on him. He then said "shengcun", referring to the first time they've met; as Oliver apologized for him about what happened to Shado, Yao Fei said that it won't bring her back, such as it won't bring back Taiana, Akio, Sara or any other person he lost for the past 5 years back; however, Yao Fei told Oliver that he can save them by sacrifice himself like he did.</p>
    <p>Oliver then pointed the gun on his head, but as he was about to shoot himself, he experienced a hallucination of Laurel. She urged him to stop as his friends and family love him and need him at home. Laurel begged Oliver to come home, because if he didn't, then his father and her sister's deaths would be for nothing. Laurel then disappeared, and Oliver used the gun and shot the lock of the cell, opening the door and walking out.[56] However, Oliver is chased by several of Kovar's men, but he outwits and kills them all before encountering a wounded Kovar. They both brawl it out, with Kovar saying that he didn't need to kill Oliver, but to rather prevent him from catching the boat. Luckily, Oliver is able to gain the upper hand and snap Kovar's neck.</p>
    <p>With the 48 hours done, Oliver ran to grab his gear and wig. He arrived at the shore, and shot an arrow at the bonfire, igniting it on fire and alerting the duo of nearby <a href="">Chinese fishermen</a>, who then rescued him.</p>
    <p>The fishermen also gave Oliver a phone, which he used to contact his mother <a href="">Moira</a> and assure her that he was alive and coming back home in a brief tearful reunion.</p>
    <p>At his return to <a href="">Starling City</a>, Oliver vowed to either extort or kill everyone on <a href="">The List</a> who was poisoning his home in a crusade to right his father's wrongs.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Crusade Begins</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Upon arriving home, Oliver was given several medical exams at <a href="">Starling General</a>, where Dr. <a href="">Neil Lamb</a> revealed to his mother that he had multiple scars, burns, and bone fractures which never properly healed. Oliver returned home with his mother to the <a href="">Queen Mansion</a>, where he reunited with his sister, <a href="">Thea</a>, and met his new step-father, <a href="">Walter-Steele</a>. While struggling with signs of post-traumatic stress and reintegrating into his home, Oliver spent time with his family and best friend, <a href="">Tommy</a>.</p>
    <p>The next day, Oliver paid a visit to <a href="">Laurel</a>, now a lawyer prosecuting <a href="">Adam Hunt</a>, at <a href="">CNRI</a>, to apologize for cheating on her and his role in <a href="">Sara</a>'s death. Laurel did not care for his apology, as she was still angry over his betrayal. Just then, Oliver and Tommy were taken hostage by three men wearing red skull masks, who killed a bystander in the process. The men used a taser to interrogate Oliver, demanding to know whether his father survived the accident or told him anything.</p>
    <p>However, Oliver managed to break his zip ties and killed two of the kidnappers to save himself and Tommy. When one of the skull-masked men tried to escape, Oliver pursued him through rooftops before disarming him. The man tried to plead for his life, but Oliver pointed out he killed a civilian. He snapped the man's neck, declaring that "nobody can know my secret".</p>
