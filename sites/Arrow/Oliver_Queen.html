    <h1>Oliver Queen</h1>
    <p>"When my <a href="#">father</a> sacrificed himself, when he gave me my extra years, what was I doing with them? I was wasting them. I was drowning myself in this sea of... of pain and darkness and saying, 'Ollie, if you just... If you cross one more name off <a href="#">The List</a>, if you save your <a href="#">city</a> one more time, then you'll absolve yourself of all of this guilt'. And I was wrong. This guilt is never going to go away. It is something that you have to learn to live with. That is why people sacrificed themselves. That is why I sacrificed myself for you, so that in all of this darkness... you... could be a guiding light... a hero."
